			This value represents which day of the week should be in the first
			column of datetime. If `null` is given autodetection will be
			attempted, and if that fails, 1 (Monday) will be used.

			The days are 0 indexed starting from Sunday:

			* 0 - Sunday
			* 1 - Monday
			* 2 - Tuesday
			* 3 - Wednesday
			* 4 - Thursday
			* 5 - Friday
			* 6 - Saturday

	<default value="null">
		The default value of `null` will result in auto detection being used.
	</default>
	<description>
		This option allows for the "first" day to be changed to any of the days
		of the week as desired.

		As of DateTime 2, this parameter supports auto detection through the
		browser's native [`Intl.Locale`
		API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale).
		Please note that this API isn't supported in Firefox at the time of
		writing. If the auto detection fails, `1` (Monday) will be used.
