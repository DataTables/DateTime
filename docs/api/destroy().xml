	<description>
		Destroys the given DateTime control, hiding and removing it from the dom and also stripping any event listeners that are in place.
		
		This example is a somewhat redundant since it creates the input element only to immediately destroy it. In a real application you would destroy the DateTime instance if you no longer require it and wish to release any memory allocated to it and its event handlers.
